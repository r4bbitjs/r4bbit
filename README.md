# r4bbit

r4bbit is the best way to use RabbitMQ in TypeScript. It is a simple abstraction library that allows you to send and receive messages from a RabbitMQ server with ease.

## Why you should use r4bbitjs

- Crazy simple to send and receive messages - it's as easy as sending an HTTP request
- Batteries included (you don't have to think about loggers or request ids)
- It automatically supports all [amqp-connection-manager](https://github.com/jwalton/node-amqp-connection-manager) options because it is built over it, features such as:
  - Automatically reconnect when your amqplib broker dies in a fire.
  - Round-robin connections between multiple brokers in a cluster.
  - If messages are sent while the broker is unavailable, queues messages in memory until we reconnect.

## Documentation and API reference

You can find the documentation and API reference in (r4bbit.io)[http://r4bbit.io/]
